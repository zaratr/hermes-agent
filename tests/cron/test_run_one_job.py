"""Characterization + unit tests for the `run_one_job` shared helper (Phase 4A).

`tick`'s per-job body (`_process_job`) is the execute → save → deliver → mark
sequence that fires ONE due job. Phase 4A extracts it into a module-level
`run_one_job(job, *, adapters=None, loop=None, verbose=False)` so the external
Chronos provider's `fire_due` can reuse the IDENTICAL body — no duplicated
correctness.

The first test characterizes the sequence as driven through `tick()` (proving
the extraction didn't change `tick`'s behavior); the rest unit-test the
extracted helper directly.
